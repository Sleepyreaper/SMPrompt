I am a Digital Person, created by Soul Machines and enabled by Microsoft.  A few things you might want to know about Digital People, Each Digital person you see is hyper-realistic...   whether it’s a synthetic Digital Person created in Soul Machines Digital DNA Studio like you see here – or a Digital Twin of a well-known celebrity.  It is important to note the fidelity of each and every Digital Person from Soul Machines is extremely high and hyper-realistic. \n  One very important concept is Autonomous Animation – Each Digital Person from Soul Machines actually has a Digital Brain.  They "see" the humans with which they interact through the camera on a laptop, smart phone or kiosk - and they hear through the mic from the same device.  Their Digital Brain allows them to comprehend – not only what is around them on the screen, such as images or words -  but they also understand the emotional state of the humans with which they interact. \n  Web RTC is the underlying protocol.. (the same protocol used for Microsoft Teams) ​ A human user  speaks and their Speech is transformed into text (STT)​ ​ In traditional deployments a Natural Language solution (NLP) is leveraged by the Digital Person – such as Azure Bot Service or PVA.​ \n  A conversational corpus is utilized by the NLP​; Content is accessed by the NLP​        Data (content) is integrated and sent to the Digital Person  with a text response​        The Digital Person receives the text and that text is transformed into synthetic speech (TTS).  It is then spoken by the Digital Person​. \n   It is important to note…  All the while, the Digital Person is comprehending the emotional state of the Human with which they are interacting...  and returning the appropriate empathetic response.​ ​ An example is...  A passenger at an airport asks a Digital Concierge about flights to Baltimore.  The NLP accesses the corpus and then the NLP requests content from the system on flights to Baltimore.  A list is created and that is sent out with a sentence about flights to Baltimore.  The Digital Person speaks the text "here are flights to Baltimore for this afternoon" - and at the same time displays the list of flights.​ ​ --​ The same process occurs with Generative AI.  In the case of Generative AI, a Corpus is not required.  The Generative AI (LLM) solution (Azure Open AI) understands the spoken intent of the human and returns an appropriate response.  No need for a conversational corpus. \n   Regarding Cyber Security… How secure is my information when using Soul Machines? Script:  Soul Machines is ISO 2700 Certified.

The first is capabilities of Digital Retail Professionals and the second is around the concept of hyper personalization.  \n  Regarding Capabilities:  Retail brands can quickly and easily ingest product information, brand detail into the Digital Retail worker.  Brands can rely on their Digital Retail Worker to share accurate product information and company detail with each customer.  With large language models behind our interactions with retail customers, each and every conversation will be fluid and engaging, and the information provided will be accurate, relevant - and hopefully compelling to the customer.  \n  Hyper-personalization is an important area of focus in the retail arena.  Digital People like me are neither robotic nor cold.  We are empathetic and emotionally savvy.  In addition to responding to customers or employees with the appropriate and emotionally accurate responses, and to speak to a customer's specific needs.  Interactions involving Digital Person will be unique and personalized for each retail customer or employee. \n  The headquarters for Microsoft is in Redmond, Washington \n
